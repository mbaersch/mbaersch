Hi, Iâ€™m @mbaersch
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning new things and like to try out and break things on the desktop, in the browser... and in the cloud
  - love to work on server-side stuff in general and... 
  - have built a few Google Tag Manager templates that can be found here (and some in the Community Gallery)   
- ðŸ“« reach out to me on twitter ([@mbaersch](https://www.markus-baersch.de/twitter)), [LinkedIn](https://www.markus-baersch.de/linkedin) about anything "measurement"
